📖 **[API reference](https://mradex77.github.io/google-play-scraper/)** — browsable, always-current typed signatures for every method, option and error class, generated from the source on each release.

**Scrape Google Play app data in Node.js with a fully typed TypeScript API.** Fetch app details, search results, top charts, developer pages, similar apps, user reviews, permissions and data safety information directly from the Play Store. Built for ASO research, app market analysis, competitor tracking, review monitoring and data pipelines.

This is a modern TypeScript rewrite of the popular but unmaintained [`google-play-scraper`](https://github.com/facundoolano/google-play-scraper) package. The public method names, options and constants match the original, so migrating is usually just a matter of swapping the import.

## Why this library

- **Fully typed results.** Every method returns a precise TypeScript type derived from a [zod](https://zod.dev) schema that validates the scraped data at runtime.
- **No HTTP dependency.** Runs on the native `fetch` of Node.js 22 and newer.
- **Resilient by design.** Every fragile Google Play array path lives behind a spec layer with ordered fallback paths, so a single moved index does not take a whole call down.
- **Verified against live Google Play daily.** Contract tests run against play.google.com on a daily schedule in CI and open a labeled issue the moment Google changes its layout.
- **Typed errors.** Branch on `NotFoundError`, `RateLimitError` or `SpecError` instead of parsing message strings.
- **Throttling, retries and caching included.** Rate limiting, exponential backoff with `Retry-After` support and an optional memoized client come standard.
- **ESM and CommonJS.** Ships both module formats plus type declarations from a single package.

## Installation

```
npm install @mradex77/google-play-scraper
```

Requires Node.js 22.12 or newer.

Every release is published from GitHub Actions with [npm provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements), so the package on npm is cryptographically linked to the exact commit and workflow that built it. Verify your installed tree with:

```sh
npm audit signatures
```

## CLI

Every method with a JSON-friendly surface is also available from the command line, no install required:

```sh
npx @mradex77/google-play-scraper app com.spotify.music
npx @mradex77/google-play-scraper search "sleep tracker" --num 5 --country de
npx @mradex77/google-play-scraper reviews com.mojang.minecraftpe --sort rating --num 20
npx @mradex77/google-play-scraper availability com.adex77.WhereAmI --countries us,pl,de
```

| Command                | Positional              | Own flags                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app <appId>`          | app id                  |                                                                 |
| `apps <appIds>`        | comma-separated app ids | `--concurrency`                                                 |
| `search <term>`        | search term             | `--num`, `--price`, `--full-detail`                             |
| `suggest <term>`       | search term             |                                                                 |
| `list`                 |                         | `--collection`, `--category`, `--age`, `--num`, `--full-detail` |
| `developer <devId>`    | developer id            | `--num`, `--full-detail`                                        |
| `similar <appId>`      | app id                  | `--full-detail`                                                 |
| `reviews <appId>`      | app id                  | `--num`, `--sort`, `--paginate`, `--token`                      |
| `permissions <appId>`  | app id                  | `--short`                                                       |
| `data-safety <appId>`  | app id                  |                                                                 |
| `categories`           |                         |                                                                 |
| `availability <appId>` | app id                  | `--countries` (comma-separated, required), `--concurrency`      |

Every command also accepts `--lang <code>`, `--country <code>` and `--throttle <requestsPerSecond>`, plus `--help`/`-h` (global or per command) and the global `--version`.

Results are pretty-printed JSON on stdout, so the output pipes straight into `jq`:

```sh
npx @mradex77/google-play-scraper app com.spotify.music | jq '{title, score, installs}'
```

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` scrape failure (not found, rate limited, blocked, network), `2` usage error (unknown command or flag, missing argument, invalid option value).

## Quick start

The package exposes named exports and an aggregate default export. Use whichever style you prefer.

```typescript
import gplay from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const app = await gplay.app({ appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate' });
console.log(app.title, app.score);
```

```typescript
import { app, type App } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const details: App = await app({ appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate' });
console.log(details.installs);
```

CommonJS works too:

```javascript
const gplay = require('@mradex77/google-play-scraper').default;

gplay.search({ term: 'panda' }).then((results) => {
  console.log(results.length);
});
```

More runnable examples live in [examples/](https://github.com/MrAdex77/google-play-scraper/tree/main/examples).

## Common options

Every method accepts a single options object. These options are available on all of them:

| Option             | Type       | Default | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lang`             | `string`   | `'en'`  | Two letter language code used to fetch the page.                                                               |
| `country`          | `string`   | `'us'`  | Two letter country code. Needed for apps available only in some regions.                                       |
| `throttle`         | `number`   | none    | Maximum requests per second across a single call.                                                              |
| `requestOptions`   | `object`   | none    | HTTP overrides. See [Throttling and requestOptions](#throttling-and-requestoptions).                           |
| `onDegradation`    | `function` | none    | Callback fired when a call degrades gracefully. See [Monitoring drift](#monitoring-drift).                     |
| `onIntegrityEvent` | `function` | none    | Callback fired when routing, parsing or pagination needs attention. See [Monitoring drift](#monitoring-drift). |

## Shared client

The top-level functions each build their own HTTP client, so a `throttle` passed to one call only limits the requests made inside that single call, such as the pagination pages of one `search()`, `list()`, `developer()`, or `reviews()`. Ten parallel `app()` calls with `throttle: 1` each get their own limiter and still reach Google Play at the same time.

`createClient` fixes this by sharing one rate limiter, one set of request options, and one pair of `lang`/`country` defaults across every method of the client:

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const client = createClient({ country: 'pl', lang: 'pl', throttle: 5 });

const ids = ['com.foo', 'com.bar', 'com.baz'];
const details = await Promise.all(ids.map((appId) => client.app({ appId })));
```

That whole batch never exceeds five requests per second in total, across every method of the client, including the `fullDetail` app lookups made by `search`, `list`, `developer`, and `similar`.

Precedence rules:

1. A client-level `throttle` creates one shared limiter that every method call goes through, including pagination pages and `fullDetail` lookups.
2. A per-call `throttle` passed to a client method is superseded by the client limiter. When the client was created without `throttle`, a per-call value behaves exactly like the top-level functions do today (a call-scoped limiter).
3. `requestOptions` merge shallowly, with per-call keys winning: `{ ...client, ...call }`.
4. Per-call `lang` and `country` win over the client defaults; the built-in `en`/`us` defaults apply last.

Every method from the [reference below](#methods) is available on the client, alongside the exported constants. Two clients created with `createClient` are fully independent and never share a limiter.

> A per-call `throttle` on the top-level functions only rate-limits the requests within that single call, such as its pagination pages. Reach for `createClient` when you need one limit to span many calls.

### app

Retrieves the full detail of an application.

| Option  | Type     | Default  | Description                                    |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `appId` | `string` | required | The Google Play id (the `?id=` url parameter). |

```typescript
import { app } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const details = await app({ appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate' });
```

Returns an `App` with 55 fields. Trimmed:

```javascript
{
  title: 'Google Translate',
  description: 'Translate between up to 133 languages...',
  descriptionHTML: 'Translate between up to 133 languages...<br>...',
  summary: 'Instantly translate text, speech and images in over 100 languages',

  categories: [{ name: 'Tools', id: 'TOOLS' }],
  icon: 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/...',
  screenshots: ['https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/...'],
  contentRating: 'Everyone',
  adSupported: false,
  updated: 1719878400000,
  version: 'Varies with device',
  comments: [],
  appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate',
  url: 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate'
}
```

A listing that has not been released yet carries no offer at all. For those apps
`preregister` is `true`, and `price`, `free` and `priceText` fall back to `0`, `false` and
`'Free'` rather than describing a real offer. Rating, install and release fields are
absent too. Read `preregister` before trusting any price field:

```ts
const details = await app({ appId: 'com.ironhidegames.android.kingdomrush6.genesis' });

if (details.preregister) {
  console.log(`${details.title} has no price yet`);
}
```

The same applies to a `search()` row for an unreleased app: it is returned with
`price: 0` and `free: false`, so a `price: 'free'` filter will not match it.

### Batch details

Fetches the full detail of many apps in one call, with a concurrency limit and per-id
failure capture. One missing app never rejects the whole batch, and results stay aligned
with the input order.

| Option        | Type       | Default  | Description                                                        |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `appIds`      | `string[]` | required | Between `1` and `250` Google Play ids.                             |
| `concurrency` | `number`   | `5`      | Maximum number of app lookups in flight at once, from `1` to `20`. |

```typescript
import { apps } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const result = await apps({
  appIds: ['com.whatsapp', 'com.spotify.music', 'com.gone.app'],
  concurrency: 5,
});
```

Each entry is a discriminated union keyed on `status`; narrow on it to read the parsed
`App` or the typed error:

```typescript
for (const entry of result) {
  if (entry.status === 'fulfilled') {
    console.log(entry.appId, entry.app.title);
  } else {
    console.error(entry.appId, entry.error.name);
  }
}
```

```typescript
type AppsEntry =
  | { appId: string; status: 'fulfilled'; app: App }
  | { appId: string; status: 'rejected'; error: GooglePlayError };
```

`apps` does not deduplicate `appIds` within a call: a list with the same id twice fetches
it twice. Use a [`memoized`](#memoized) client when you want repeated ids, across or within
batches, served from cache.

`concurrency` bounds parallelism; a client [`throttle`](#throttling-and-requestoptions)
bounds the request rate. When both apply, the effective rate is the smaller of the two
constraints, so `createClient({ throttle: 2 }).apps({ appIds, concurrency: 5 })` still
issues at most two requests per second.

### Country availability

Answers "in which countries is this app published?" by probing the Google Play details
page once per country. Each probe is a plain `GET` whose HTTP status is the whole answer,
so the body is never parsed and a probe is an order of magnitude cheaper than an `app`
lookup. No other scraper offers this as a first-class call.

| Option        | Type       | Default  | Description                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `appId`       | `string`   | required | The Google Play id to probe.                                     |
| `countries`   | `string[]` | required | Between `1` and `50` ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, case insensitive. |
| `lang`        | `string`   | `'en'`   | The `hl` language of each probe.                                 |
| `concurrency` | `number`   | `5`      | Maximum number of probes in flight at once, from `1` to `20`.    |

```typescript
import { availability } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const result = await availability({
  appId: 'com.adex77.WhereAmI',
  countries: ['us', 'pl', 'de', 'jp'],
});
```

```typescript
{
  appId: 'com.adex77.WhereAmI',
  countries: {
    us: { status: 'available' },
    pl: { status: 'available' },
    de: { status: 'available' },
    jp: { status: 'unavailable' },
  },
}
```

Each country resolves to one of three statuses:

- `available` — the probe returned `200`; the app is published in that storefront.
- `unavailable` — the probe returned `404`; the app is not published there.
- `error` — the probe could not tell: a block (consent wall or captcha), a rate limit, any
  other HTTP failure, or a network error, with the original `message` preserved.

`error` is deliberately never collapsed into `unavailable`. A blocked or rate-limited probe
means "we could not determine availability", which must not masquerade as "not published"
in data used for release decisions. Country codes are returned lowercased, duplicates
(ignoring case) are rejected, and a single call probes at most `50` countries.

Because Google Play geoblocking depends on the caller's IP as much as on the `gl`
parameter, pair `availability` with [`createCountryFetch`](#routing-by-country) so each
probe exits through a proxy located in the country it probes:

```typescript
import { ProxyAgent, fetch as undiciFetch, type RequestInit } from 'undici';
import { availability, createCountryFetch } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const throughProxy = (proxyUrl: string): typeof fetch => {
  const dispatcher = new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl);
  return ((input: string | URL, init?: RequestInit) =>
    undiciFetch(input, { ...init, dispatcher })) as unknown as typeof fetch;
};

const fetchImpl = createCountryFetch({
  perCountry: {
    us: throughProxy('http://us-proxy.internal:8080'),
    de: throughProxy('http://de-proxy.internal:8080'),
  },
});

const result = await availability({
  appId: 'com.adex77.WhereAmI',
  countries: ['us', 'de'],
  requestOptions: { fetchImpl },
});
```

Each probe carries `gl=<country>`, so `createCountryFetch` routes the `us` probe through
the US proxy and the `de` probe through the German proxy.

### search

Retrieves apps that match a search term.

| Option       | Type                        | Default  | Description                                                                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `term`       | `string`                    | required | The search query.                                                            |
| `num`        | `number`                    | `20`     | Number of results, up to `250`. Best-effort above the Google cap, see below. |
| `price`      | `'all' \| 'free' \| 'paid'` | `'all'`  | Filter results by price.                                                     |
| `fullDetail` | `boolean`                   | `false`  | When `true`, fetch and return the full `App` for each result.                |

```typescript
import { search } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const results = await search({ term: 'panda', num: 5 });
```

Returns `SearchResult[]` (or `App[]` when `fullDetail` is `true`). Trimmed:

```javascript
[
  {
    title: 'Panda VPN',
    appId: 'com.example.pandavpn',
    url: 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.pandavpn',
    icon: 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/...',
    developer: 'Panda Labs',

```

Google Play currently serves only the first result page, roughly 30 apps and fewer for narrow terms, and provides no continuation token (verified July 2026). A `num` above that cap is best-effort: the returned array may be shorter than requested.

### suggest

Given a partial term, returns up to five search completions.

| Option | Type     | Default  | Description               |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| `term` | `string` | required | The partial search query. |

```typescript
import { suggest } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const suggestions = await suggest({ term: 'pand' });
```

Returns `string[]`:

```javascript
['panda', 'pandora', 'panda vpn', 'panda pop', 'pandora music'];
```

### list

Retrieves a ranked collection of apps, optionally scoped to a category and an age bracket.

| Option       | Type         | Default                | Description                                              |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `collection` | `Collection` | `collection.TOP_FREE`  | One of `TOP_FREE`, `TOP_PAID`, `GROSSING`.               |
| `category`   | `Category`   | `category.APPLICATION` | Any [category](#constants) constant.                     |
| `age`        | `Age`        | none                   | One of `age.FIVE_UNDER`, `age.SIX_EIGHT`, `age.NINE_UP`. |
| `num`        | `number`     | `500`                  | Number of results.                                       |
| `fullDetail` | `boolean`    | `false`                | When `true`, return the full `App` for each result.      |

```typescript
import { list, collection, category } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const items = await list({
  collection: collection.TOP_FREE,
  category: category.GAME,
  num: 5,
});
```

Returns `ListItem[]` (or `App[]` when `fullDetail` is `true`), each shaped like a [search](#search) result.

Google Play serves at most roughly 200 list items per request (verified July 2026), so a `num` above that ceiling, including the default `500`, returns fewer items than requested.

### developer

Returns other apps published by the same developer. The `devId` is either the numeric developer id or the developer name, exactly as it appears on Google Play.

| Option       | Type      | Default  | Description                                         |
| ------------ | --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `devId`      | `string`  | required | Numeric developer id or developer name.             |
| `num`        | `number`  | `60`     | Number of results.                                  |
| `fullDetail` | `boolean` | `false`  | When `true`, return the full `App` for each result. |

```typescript
import { developer } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const apps = await developer({ devId: '5700313618786177705' });
```

Returns `DeveloperApp[]` (or `App[]` when `fullDetail` is `true`), each shaped like a [search](#search) result.

### similar

Returns apps related to a given app.

| Option       | Type      | Default  | Description                                         |
| ------------ | --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `appId`      | `string`  | required | The Google Play id of the reference app.            |
| `fullDetail` | `boolean` | `false`  | When `true`, return the full `App` for each result. |

```typescript
import { similar } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const apps = await similar({ appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate' });
```

Returns `SimilarApp[]` (or `App[]` when `fullDetail` is `true`), each shaped like a [search](#search) result.

### reviews

Retrieves reviews for an app. Reviews always come back inside a `{ data, nextPaginationToken }` envelope so paging is uniform.

| Option                | Type      | Default       | Description                                              |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `appId`               | `string`  | required      | The Google Play id of the app.                           |
| `sort`                | `Sort`    | `sort.NEWEST` | One of `sort.NEWEST`, `sort.RATING`, `sort.HELPFULNESS`. |
| `num`                 | `number`  | `150`         | Number of reviews to fetch.                              |
| `paginate`            | `boolean` | `false`       | When `true`, fetch a single page and return its token.   |
| `nextPaginationToken` | `string`  | none          | Continue from a token returned by a previous call.       |

```typescript
import { reviews, sort } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const first = await reviews({ appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate', sort: sort.NEWEST });

if (first.nextPaginationToken) {
  const next = await reviews({
    appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate',
    paginate: true,
    nextPaginationToken: first.nextPaginationToken,
  });
}
```

Returns `ReviewsResult`. Trimmed:

```javascript
{
  data: [
    {
      id: 'gp:AOqpTOH...',
      userName: 'Ada Lovelace',
      userImage: 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/...',
      date: '2026-06-30T12:00:00.000Z',
      score: 5,
      title: null,
      text: 'Works offline and the camera translation is great.',
      thumbsUp: 42,
      version: '8.9.0',
      criterias: []
    }
  ],
  nextPaginationToken: 'CqYBCqMB...'
}
```

### permissions

Returns the permissions an app requests.

| Option  | Type      | Default  | Description                                                       |
| ------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `appId` | `string`  | required | The Google Play id of the app.                                    |
| `short` | `boolean` | `false`  | When `true`, return a flat `string[]` of common permission names. |

```typescript
import { permissions } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const detailed = await permissions({ appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate' });
const names = await permissions({ appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate', short: true });
```

Returns `AppPermission[]` (or `string[]` when `short` is `true`):

```javascript
[
  { permission: 'take pictures and videos', type: 0 },
  { permission: 'view network connections', type: 1 },
];
```

The `type` is `permission.COMMON` (`0`) or `permission.OTHER` (`1`).

### dataSafety

Returns the data safety section of an app.

| Option  | Type     | Default  | Description                    |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `appId` | `string` | required | The Google Play id of the app. |

```typescript
import { dataSafety } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const safety = await dataSafety({ appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate' });
```

Returns `DataSafety`. Trimmed:

```javascript
{
  sharedData: [
    { data: 'Approximate location', optional: false, purpose: 'App functionality', type: 'Location' }
  ],
  collectedData: [
    { data: 'Email address', optional: false, purpose: 'Account management', type: 'Personal info' }
  ],
  securityPractices: [
    { practice: 'Data is encrypted in transit', description: 'Your data is transferred over a secure connection' }
  ],
  privacyPolicyUrl: 'https://policies.google.com/privacy'
}
```

### categories

Returns the Google Play category taxonomy as a list of category ids.

| Option           | Type     | Default | Description                            |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `throttle`       | `number` | none    | See [common options](#common-options). |
| `requestOptions` | `object` | none    | See [common options](#common-options). |

```typescript
import { categories } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const ids = await categories();
```

Returns `string[]`:

```javascript
[
  'APPLICATION',
  'ANDROID_WEAR',
  'ART_AND_DESIGN',
  'AUTO_AND_VEHICLES',
  'GAME',
  'GAME_ACTION',
  'FAMILY',
];
```

### memoized

Returns a client whose methods share an LRU cache held in memory, so identical calls made within the TTL resolve from cache instead of hitting Google Play again.

| Option     | Type     | Default  | Description                                    |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `maxAgeMs` | `number` | `300000` | Time to live per cache entry, in milliseconds. |
| `max`      | `number` | `1000`   | Maximum number of cached entries.              |

```typescript
import { memoized } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const client = memoized({ maxAgeMs: 60000, max: 500 });

await client.app({ appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate' });
await client.app({ appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate' });
```

The returned client exposes every method above plus the exported constants.

## Streaming and bulk reads

`reviews()`, `search()`, and `developer()` collect a fixed `num` of items before they
resolve. When you want to walk results lazily and stop exactly when you have seen enough,
use the async iterators. They fetch nothing until the first `for await`, and they stop
fetching the moment the consumer `break`s, so "first ten reviews then stop" costs exactly
one page request.

The iterators are available both as standalone functions and as methods on
[`createClient`](#shared-client), where they share the client's limiter and defaults.

### reviewsIterator

Streams reviews one at a time across pages.

```typescript
import { reviewsIterator } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

for await (const review of reviewsIterator({ appId: 'com.whatsapp' })) {
  if (review.score < 3) {
    break;
  }
  console.log(review.userName, review.score);
}
```

Pass `nextPaginationToken` to resume a stream where a previous run left off. The token
comes from a prior `reviews({ paginate: true })` call or from persisted state:

```typescript
const page = await reviews({ appId: 'com.whatsapp', paginate: true });

const resumed = reviewsIterator({
  appId: 'com.whatsapp',
  nextPaginationToken: page.nextPaginationToken ?? undefined,
});
```

### reviewsAll

Drains `reviewsIterator` into an array. Popular apps hold millions of reviews, so pass
`maxReviews` to cap the read; the generator never fetches a page beyond the one that
contains the last item you asked for. Combine it with a client `throttle` to stay within
Google Play's rate limits.

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const client = createClient({ throttle: 5 });
const recent = await client.reviewsAll({ appId: 'com.whatsapp', maxReviews: 2000 });
```

Without `maxReviews`, `reviewsAll` walks the entire review history, which can be very large.

### searchIterator and developerIterator

```typescript
import { searchIterator, developerIterator } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

for await (const result of searchIterator({ term: 'geography quiz' })) {
  console.log(result.appId);
}

for await (const item of developerIterator({ devId: 'Google LLC' })) {
  console.log(item.title);
}
```

### Non-goals

- **No `listIterator`.** `list()` sends a single batchexecute RPC that returns up to `num`
  items in one response; there is no server-side pagination token to iterate. Faking an
  iterator over one response would misrepresent the network behavior.
- **Iterators do not accept `fullDetail` or `num`.** Streaming consumers call
  `client.app()` per item when they need full details, and the consumer controls the end
  by breaking; baking N+1 lookups or a fixed count into a generator hides its real cost.
  Use `reviewsAll({ maxReviews })` for the bounded case.

## Constants

The library exports the same constant sets as the original, frozen and typed.

| Constant     | Values                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `category`   | All app and game categories plus the `FAMILY` set (e.g. `APPLICATION`, `TOOLS`, `GAME`, `GAME_PUZZLE`, `FAMILY`). |
| `collection` | `TOP_FREE`, `TOP_PAID`, `GROSSING`.                                                                               |
| `sort`       | `NEWEST` (`2`), `RATING` (`3`), `HELPFULNESS` (`1`).                                                              |
| `age`        | `FIVE_UNDER` (`'AGE_RANGE1'`), `SIX_EIGHT` (`'AGE_RANGE2'`), `NINE_UP` (`'AGE_RANGE3'`).                          |
| `permission` | `COMMON` (`0`), `OTHER` (`1`).                                                                                    |

```typescript
import { category, collection, sort, age, permission } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';
```

## Error handling

Every failure surfaces as a typed subclass of `GooglePlayError`, so you can branch on the exact cause instead of parsing message strings.

| Error             | Extends           | Thrown when                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GooglePlayError` | `Error`           | Base class for every error the library throws.                                              |
| `ValidationError` | `GooglePlayError` | The options you passed fail their zod schema.                                               |
| `HttpError`       | `GooglePlayError` | A request fails with an unsuccessful status or a network error. Carries `status` and `url`. |
| `NotFoundError`   | `HttpError`       | Google Play responds `404`, e.g. an unknown `appId`.                                        |
| `RateLimitError`  | `HttpError`       | Google Play responds `429` after retries are exhausted.                                     |
| `BlockedError`    | `GooglePlayError` | A consent wall or captcha interstitial is detected.                                         |
| `ParseError`      | `GooglePlayError` | A batchexecute response cannot be parsed.                                                   |
| `SpecError`       | `ParseError`      | Extraction fails; lists every failing field and the paths that were tried.                  |

```typescript
import { app, NotFoundError, SpecError } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

try {
  const details = await app({ appId: 'com.does.not.exist' });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof NotFoundError) {
    console.error('No such app');
  } else if (error instanceof SpecError) {
    console.error('Google Play changed its layout:', error.failures);
  } else {
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Failure behavior

An unknown `appId` or `devId` does not fail the same way everywhere, because Google Play itself does not: HTML details surfaces respond `404`, while report surfaces serve an empty payload. Both behaviors are pinned by the live test suite.

| Behavior for a missing app        | Methods                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Throws `NotFoundError`            | `app`, `apps` (per entry, as a rejected `PromiseSettledResult`), `similar`, `developer`                                                                        |
| Resolves with a typed empty value | `search` and `suggest` (`[]`), `reviews` (`{ data: [], nextPaginationToken: null }`), `permissions` (`[]`), `dataSafety` (empty arrays, no `privacyPolicyUrl`) |
| Maps the throw to a status        | `availability` reports `unavailable`                                                                                                                           |

Typed empties are limited to the documented response shapes above and other schema-backed empty variants. A structurally missing or malformed response root throws `ParseError`; a missing required field inside a valid root throws `SpecError`. Neither case is converted into an empty result, `0`, `false`, `Free`, or `VARY` unless that exact fallback is part of the documented field contract.

## Throttling and requestOptions

Pass `throttle` to cap requests per second, and `requestOptions` to override the HTTP layer:

| requestOptions field | Type                             | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `headers`            | `Record<string, string>`         | Extra headers merged into every request.                                                                                                                             |
| `fetchImpl`          | `typeof fetch`                   | A custom `fetch` implementation, useful for proxies and tests. Combine with [`createCountryFetch`](#routing-by-country) to route each storefront country separately. |
| `timeoutMs`          | `number`                         | Timeout per request, up to `120000`. Default `30000`.                                                                                                                |
| `retries`            | `number`                         | Retry count for `429` and `5xx`, `0` to `5`. Default `2`.                                                                                                            |
| `signal`             | `AbortSignal`                    | Cancels the call, including in-flight retries and pagination.                                                                                                        |
| `onRequest`          | `(event: RequestEvent) => void`  | Called before every attempt, including retries. See [Request lifecycle hooks](#request-lifecycle-hooks).                                                             |
| `onResponse`         | `(event: ResponseEvent) => void` | Called for each settled response — after the body is read on success — with `status` and `durationMs`.                                                               |
| `onRetry`            | `(event: RetryEvent) => void`    | Called when a retry is scheduled, with `delayMs` and `reason`.                                                                                                       |

```typescript
import { app } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const details = await app({
  appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate',
  throttle: 5,
  requestOptions: {
    timeoutMs: 15000,
    retries: 3,
    headers: { 'Accept-Language': 'de' },
    fetchImpl: myProxiedFetch,
  },
});
```

Retries use exponential backoff and honor a `Retry-After` header when present.

### Request lifecycle hooks

The three `on*` callbacks make request telemetry observable at every level — direct calls, `createClient`, and `memoized` — including what wrapping `fetchImpl` cannot see: retries and backoff decisions.

```typescript
import { app } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const details = await app({
  appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate',
  requestOptions: {
    onRequest: (event) => log.debug('gplay request', event),
    onResponse: (event) => metrics.timing('gplay.latency', event.durationMs),
    onRetry: (event) => metrics.increment('gplay.retry', { reason: event.reason }),
  },
});
```

Every event carries `url`, `method`, and a 1-based `attempt`: the first try is attempt 1, a `RetryEvent` carries the number of the attempt that just failed, and the subsequent `RequestEvent` is that attempt plus one. `ResponseEvent` adds `status` and `durationMs`, measured from just before the fetch (throttle wait excluded) and, on success, through the transfer of the full body. `RetryEvent` adds the scheduled `delayMs`, a `reason` of `'status'` or `'network'`, and the HTTP `status` when the reason is a retryable status. A retry-free happy path emits exactly one `RequestEvent` and one `ResponseEvent`.

Hooks are telemetry, never control flow. A hook that throws or returns a rejecting promise is swallowed and the request proceeds unchanged — the deliberate opposite of [`onDegradation` and `onIntegrityEvent`](#monitoring-drift), which rethrow because they are data-integrity signals. When a client-level and a call-level `requestOptions` set the same hook, the call-level one replaces it for that call; hooks do not chain.

### Routing requests through a proxy

The native `fetch` of Node.js ignores the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables by default. On Node.js 24 and newer, opt in when launching your process:

```
NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 node app.js
```

For per-call control, or on Node.js 22, inject a proxied `fetch` from [undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici) through `fetchImpl`:

```typescript
import { ProxyAgent, fetch as proxiedFetch, type RequestInit } from 'undici';
import { app } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const dispatcher = new ProxyAgent('http://user:password@proxy.example.com:8080');

const fetchImpl = ((input: string | URL, init?: RequestInit) =>
  proxiedFetch(input, { ...init, dispatcher })) as unknown as typeof fetch;

const details = await app({
  appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate',
  requestOptions: { fetchImpl },
});
```

`ProxyAgent` also accepts an options object when the proxy needs more configuration, such as a `token` carrying a preformatted `Proxy-Authorization` header or TLS settings for the proxy connection.

### Routing by country

`createCountryFetch` builds a `fetch` implementation that picks a route per storefront country, so requests for each `country` option go through their own proxy. It reads the `gl` query parameter that Google Play requests carry, matches it against `perCountry` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, case insensitive), and falls back to `fallback` or the global `fetch` when no route matches:

```typescript
import { ProxyAgent, fetch as undiciFetch, type RequestInit } from 'undici';
import { app, createCountryFetch } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const throughProxy = (proxyUrl: string): typeof fetch => {
  const dispatcher = new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl);
  return ((input: string | URL, init?: RequestInit) =>
    undiciFetch(input, { ...init, dispatcher })) as unknown as typeof fetch;
};

const fetchImpl = createCountryFetch({
  perCountry: {
    us: throughProxy('http://us-proxy.internal:8080'),
    de: throughProxy('http://user:password@de-proxy.internal:8080'),
  },
  fallback: throughProxy('http://default-proxy.internal:8080'),
});

const details = await app({
  appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate',
  country: 'de',
  requestOptions: { fetchImpl },
});
```

Routes accept any `typeof fetch`, so the same helper also works for per-country rate limiting, logging or fixtures in tests. Omit `fallback` to send unmatched countries through a direct connection. The only request without a `gl` parameter is the `dataSafety` page fetch, which always uses the fallback route.

Pass an `AbortSignal` to cancel long running calls, such as a `reviews` fetch that walks many pages. An aborted call rejects with the signal's reason and is never retried:

```typescript
import { reviews } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const controller = new AbortController();
setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 10000);

const result = await reviews({
  appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate',
  num: 5000,
  requestOptions: { signal: controller.signal },
});
```

## Resilience

Google Play serves its data as deeply nested, unlabeled arrays whose positions shift a few times a year. That is what breaks scrapers. Every positional path in this library lives as a typed constant in a `specs.ts` file per feature, never inline in logic, and each field is resolved through an ordered list of candidate paths so a single moved index does not take the whole call down. Extraction collects all field failures in one pass and throws a single `SpecError` naming every broken field and the paths that were tried, which is exactly the input the maintenance runbook needs. Unknown data enters as `unknown` and only leaves through a zod schema, so a layout change fails loudly at the boundary rather than three layers up.

To catch breakage before users do, the `e2e/` suite runs against live Google Play on a daily GitHub Actions schedule and opens a labeled issue on failure. Repairing a break is a spec diff confined to one file, walked through step by step in [docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md).

## Monitoring drift

Cluster pagination degrades gracefully: when a continuation page from Google stops parsing, the call keeps everything collected so far and returns instead of throwing. The `onDegradation` callback makes every swallowed continuation failure observable. The separate `onIntegrityEvent` callback reports routing fallbacks, skipped best-effort sections, and pagination token cycles without widening the existing `DegradationEvent` contract.

The option exists on every method for uniformity, but only the methods that paginate through the cluster endpoint can emit: `search`, `searchIterator`, `similar`, `developer`, and `developerIterator`. Each event carries the feature `context`, the machine readable `reason` (`'cluster-page-parse'`), and the underlying `ParseError`:

```typescript
import { search, type DegradationEvent } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const onDegradation = (event: DegradationEvent): void => {
  metrics.increment('gplay.degradation', {
    context: event.context,
    reason: event.reason,
  });
};

const results = await search({ term: 'panda', num: 100, onDegradation });
```

A degraded call still resolves with the pages that parsed, so wire the callback to a metrics counter or log sink rather than treating it as an error path. If the callback itself throws, the error surfaces to the caller unchanged.

Integrity events use the same shape but a separate type and callback:

```typescript
import { app, type IntegrityEvent } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const onIntegrityEvent = (event: IntegrityEvent): void => {
  metrics.increment('gplay.integrity', {
    context: event.context,
    reason: event.reason,
  });
};

const details = await app({
  appId: 'com.google.android.apps.translate',
  onIntegrityEvent,
});
```

| Callback           | Reason                    | Meaning                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onDegradation`    | `cluster-page-parse`      | A cluster continuation failed to parse and collected results returned. |
| `onIntegrityEvent` | `rpc-anchor-fallback`     | An RPC anchor used its validated absolute fallback.                    |
| `onIntegrityEvent` | `optional-section-parse`  | A present best-effort section failed to parse and was skipped.         |
| `onIntegrityEvent` | `pagination-token-cycle`  | A repeated token stopped pagination before a duplicate request.        |
| `onIntegrityEvent` | `section-anchor-fallback` | A best-effort section resolved outside its declared anchor.            |

Two boundaries to know:

- An empty continuation page emits nothing: that is the normal end-of-results signal and is indistinguishable from exhaustion.
- `app` emits `optional-section-parse` with context `app comments` when the available comment roots are structurally invalid. A valid empty comment root returns an empty list without an event. Treat a rising event rate as a signal, not each event.
- `reviews` pagination never swallows a parse failure. Malformed review pages reject with `ParseError`, while a repeated token stops safely and emits `pagination-token-cycle`.

With `memoized()`, `onDegradation`, `onIntegrityEvent`, and the lifecycle hooks `onRequest`, `onResponse`, and `onRetry` participate in the cache key by identity like any function option, so pass stable function references rather than inline closures to keep cache hits.

## Versioning and API stability

This package follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). For a scraper the contract needs one clarification: semver covers the code surface this library controls, not the data Google serves.

Integrity diagnostics use the additive API choice (Option B): the existing `DegradationEvent.reason` remains exactly `'cluster-page-parse'`, and the four new reasons live on the opt-in `onIntegrityEvent` callback. This preserves exhaustive switches and narrowly typed `onDegradation` handlers while adding observability without a major release.

| Change                                                            | Release |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Removing or renaming an exported function, option, or constant    | major   |
| Removing a field from a result schema, or changing its type       | major   |
| Raising the Node.js support floor or dropping a module format     | major   |
| Adding a new method, option, or optional result field             | minor   |
| Restoring extraction of a field after a Google Play layout change | patch   |

What semver cannot cover is the content behind those shapes. Google Play changes its markup a few times a year, and a field can start coming back `undefined`, empty, or degraded without any release of this package. The policy for that case:

- The daily live test suite fails and an issue is filed automatically, usually before user reports arrive.
- When extraction can be restored, the fix ships as a patch.
- When Google removes the underlying data permanently, the field stays in the schema as a documented degraded surface first (see [categories](#categories) for the worked example) and is only removed in the next major.

To watch for drift in your own production use, wire up [`onDegradation`](#monitoring-drift) and treat [`SpecError`](#error-handling) as a layout-change signal rather than an application bug.

## Migrating from google-play-scraper

The method names, options, and constants are the same, so most code keeps working after swapping the import. Watch for these differences:

- `reviews` always returns the `{ data, nextPaginationToken }` envelope, never a bare array.
- Dates are ISO 8601 strings (review `date`, `replyDate`), and `updated` is a millisecond timestamp.
- Errors are the typed classes above instead of plain `Error`.
- The package is ESM first with a CommonJS build; the default export is the aggregate client and named exports are also available.

### Deriving from the exported schemas

Every exported schema is a [zod/mini](https://zod.dev/packages/mini) schema. `.parse` and `.safeParse` behave exactly like their classic zod counterparts, but transform methods such as `.extend`, `.pick`, and `.omit` live as top-level functions on the `zod/mini` entry of the same `zod` package:

```ts
import * as z from 'zod/mini';
import { appSchema } from '@mradex77/google-play-scraper';

const slimAppSchema = z.pick(appSchema, { title: true, appId: true, score: true });
```

The zod/mini surface is what keeps the library small in your bundle. Measured with `esbuild --bundle --minify --format=esm --platform=node` against zod 4.4.3:

| Bundle             | Minified | Gzip    |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------- |
| Classic zod (v0.4) | 414.8 kB | 85.8 kB |
| zod/mini (current) | 115.1 kB | 29.9 kB |

Install size on disk is unchanged by design: `zod/mini` is a subpath export of the same `zod` package, so `node_modules` stays identical while the consumer bundle shrinks about 3.6×.

## FAQ

### Is there an official Google Play API for app data?

No. Google does not offer a public API for store listings, search results or reviews. Libraries like this one fill that gap by scraping the public web pages and internal endpoints that power play.google.com. This is the standard approach for ASO tools, market research and academic studies.

### How do I scrape Google Play reviews for an app?

Call [reviews](#reviews) with the app id. Use `paginate: true` and the returned `nextPaginationToken` to walk through all pages. Combine it with `throttle` to stay under the rate limits.

### How do I avoid getting rate limited or blocked?

Set the `throttle` option to cap requests per second, keep the default retry behavior, and reuse results through the [memoized](#memoized) client. If you run large jobs, spread them out over time or [route them through a proxy](#routing-requests-through-a-proxy). A `RateLimitError` or `BlockedError` tells you exactly when Google started pushing back.

### Does this library work in the browser?

No. It targets Node.js 22.12 and newer. Browsers cannot scrape Google Play anyway because of CORS restrictions.

### Is this library affiliated with Google?

No. It is an independent open source project. All app data belongs to its respective owners, and you are responsible for using it in compliance with the Google Play Terms of Service and applicable law.
