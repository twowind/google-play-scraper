## Reading the evidence column

`recorded fixture` evidence means a field is present in every recorded fixture. That is evidence a field is
usually populated, not evidence it is structurally guaranteed. The fixture set records popular, rated, globally
available listings, so a source that is present in all three fixtures can still be absent on an unrated listing,
a brand new listing, or a listing restricted to another storefront. Classify a field as `required` only when an
absent source means the response is genuinely unusable, and prefer `established test` evidence that exercises
the absent case directly. The live contract tests in `e2e/edgeCases.e2e.test.ts` cover the listing shapes the
fixtures do not.

The exact match card carries a second copy of `url`, `price` and `currency`
inside its detail node, so those four specs declare both paths. `title`,
`appId`, `icon` and `developer` have exactly one source in the card. They stay
required with a single path, and a drift in any of them drops the card. The live
tripwire registered in `docs/RUNBOOK.md` is the only thing that catches that.
